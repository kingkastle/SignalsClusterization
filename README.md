Signal Generator!
===================

Signal generator is a python module that generates a bunch of signals, based in cosine and random functions to generate an entire dataset to perform over them different clustering algorithms. Main functions include:

> **Main Functions**:
>  - Data Normalization
>  - Matplotlib Graphs
>  - Scikit Clusterization

Test Case
-------------------
By executing the Python file SignalGenerator as "__main__" you can run a test scenario to get an example of the main functionalities included in the script.
